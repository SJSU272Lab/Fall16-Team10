Abstract: 
Gun violence is an important national problem leading to more than 31,000 deaths and 78,000 non-fatal injuries every year. The most consistent and powerful predictor of future violence is a history of violent behavior. Thus, GunAway may prevent gun violence for those persons at risk due to mental illness, suicidal thoughts, or feelings of desperation.
The prediction of an individualâ€™s propensity for violence is a complex and challenging task. It involves the analyze of information to assess if a person poses a threat of violence or self-harm, and if so, take steps to intervene. GunAway wants to take action to protect potential victims when it judges a person poses a danger to others.
